To replace the legacy Sakai LMS site with something that truly reflects its 20-year heritage, real open-source ethos, and modern Java foundation, we need to ditch the "generic SaaS" playbook. No soft pastel gradients, no floating corporate illustrations, and no generic buzzwords.

Instead, we will use an Astro project with Tailwind CSS. We'll aim for a design I call "Modern Academic Brutalism" mixed with vibrant community energy: bold typography, high-contrast colors (deep indigos, rich terracottas, and warm cream backgrounds), and sharp, opinionated layouts.
