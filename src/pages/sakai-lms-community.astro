    <h2 class="sans mt-2 text-2xl font-black uppercase">Andrea Schmidt Elected To Sakai PMC</h2>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-[var(--sakai-paper)]/90">
      Andrea Schmidt (Learning Experiences) is the newest elected member of the Sakai Project Management Committee (PMC).
      The PMC gets involved when broader project decisions are needed around Sakai direction or Apereo-backed resource use.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-[var(--sakai-paper)]/90">
      Andrea serves as Sakai QA Lead and brings more than two decades of technical quality experience. She has contributed to
      Sakai QA since 2017 and has led global QA coordination since August 2022, including weekly QA facilitation, regression
      planning, and Jira verification across releases.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-[var(--sakai-paper)]/90">
      PMC membership reflects sustained contribution and commitment to community goals. Most day-to-day Sakai decisions are still
      made in working groups closest to the work, with PMC engagement for significant cross-project matters.
